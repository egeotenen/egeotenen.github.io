Hi, all this is my personal webpage! I'm a MSc student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/). I'm interested in autobiographical memory, visual imagery, spatial ability and computational social science. I'm working with [Asst. Prof. Cagla Aydin](https://fass.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty-members/detail/1980) at CLAM Lab. 
I am also a current member of [MACC Lab](https://www.gunselilab.com/) under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Eren Gunseli](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/erengunseli/) which mainly investigates attention and memory. 
And I am trying to learn techniques of computational social science under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/) at [Varol Lab](http://varollab.com/).

I received my undergraduate degree in psychology from Middle East Technical University. During my undergraduate years, I contributed several projects at METU Child and Adolescent Development Lab, PI: [Assc. Prof. Basak Sahin-Acar](http://psy.metu.edu.tr/en/basak-sahin-acar), METU Life Span Development Laboratory, PI: [Asst. Prof. Emre Selcuk](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/emreselcuk/). I completed my internship at [Center on Autobiographical Memory  Research, CON AMORE](https://psy.au.dk/en/research/research-centres-and-units/conamore/) under the supervision of [Prof. Annette Bohn](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/annette-bohn(63156000-0ce0-4610-b068-ee3354380b04).html) and [Dr. Muge Ozbek Akcay](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=iuB-cpUAAAAJ&hl=en).
