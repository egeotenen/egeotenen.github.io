Hi all, this is my personal webpage! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Science and Informatics (HCI) dual degree program at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am interested in the reciprocal relationship between autobiographical memory and technology. I am currently working with [Dr. Erik Stolterman Bergqvist](https://www.stoltermanbergqvist.com) on understanding the role of modalities as cognitive affordances for autobiographical memories and developing design frameworks for enhancing user experience and well-being and with [Dr. Fritz Breithaupt](https://www.experimentalhumanities.com/people) on the influence of social media on meaningful life memories. My research interests have also expanded into the co-remembering process between humans and AI, which sparked my curiosity about the theory of mind in interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs).

I earned my Cognitive Psychology MSc degree at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/). I have been working with [Dr. Cagla Aydin](https://fass.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty-members/detail/1980) at the CLAM Lab. And I have been a former member of [Varol Lab](https://varollab.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](https://www.onurvarol.com/). 

I received my BSc in psychology from Middle East Technical University. During my undergraduate years, I contributed to several projects at METU Child and Adolescent Development Lab, PI: [Dr. Basak Sahin-Acar](https://psy.metu.edu.tr/en/basak-sahin-acar), METU Life Span Development Laboratory, PI: [Dr. Emre Selcuk](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/emreselcuk/). I completed my internship at the [Center on Autobiographical Memory  Research, CON AMORE](https://psy.au.dk/en/research/research-centres-and-units/conamore/) under the supervision of [Dr. Annette Bohn](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/annette-bohn(63156000-0ce0-4610-b068-ee3354380b04).html) and [Dr. Muge Ozbek Akcay](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=iuB-cpUAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I also write weekly diaries throughout my PhD, you can access it [here!](https://sites.google.com/view/otenenege/2024-2025?authuser=0)
