Hi all, this is my personal webpage! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Science and Informatics dual degree program at Indiana University, Bloomington. I'm working with [Dr. Johan Bollen](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/jbollen/). My research interests lie in computational social science, autobiographical memory, language, individual differences. 

I earned my Cognitive Psychology MSc degree at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/). I have been working with [Dr. Cagla Aydin](https://fass.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty-members/detail/1980) at the CLAM Lab. And I have been a former member of [Varol Lab](http://varollab.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/). 

I received my BSc in psychology from Middle East Technical University. During my undergraduate years, I contributed to several projects at METU Child and Adolescent Development Lab, PI: [Dr. Basak Sahin-Acar](http://psy.metu.edu.tr/en/basak-sahin-acar), METU Life Span Development Laboratory, PI: [Dr. Emre Selcuk](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/emreselcuk/). I completed my internship at the [Center on Autobiographical Memory  Research, CON AMORE](https://psy.au.dk/en/research/research-centres-and-units/conamore/) under the supervision of [Dr. Annette Bohn](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/annette-bohn(63156000-0ce0-4610-b068-ee3354380b04).html) and [Dr. Muge Ozbek Akcay](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=iuB-cpUAAAAJ&hl=en).
